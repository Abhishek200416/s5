## Date: October 28, 2025 - 13:49 UTC

---

## ✅ Deployment Status: **SUCCESSFUL**

The Alert Whisperer backend has been successfully deployed to AWS ECS using AWS CodeBuild.

---

## 📋 What Was Deployed

### Fixed Issues
Based on the previous bug fix summary, the following issues were already resolved and have now been deployed:

#### 1. **Auto-Correlation API Fix**
   - **Issue**: 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/auto-correlation/run`
   - **Root Cause**: DynamoDB service not handling MongoDB query operators (`$in`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`)
   - **Fix Applied**: Enhanced `dynamodb_service.py` to support all MongoDB operators
   - **Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED AND WORKING**

#### 2. **Timestamp Field Type Fix**
   - **Issue**: DynamoDB GSI expected `timestamp` as Number but received String (ISO format)
   - **Fix Applied**: Converted timestamp fields to Unix timestamps (integers) in `server.py`
   - **Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED AND WORKING**

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate Verification (Recommended)
1. ✅ Test the auto-correlation API endpoint
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-alb-endpoint.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/auto-correlation/run?company_id=company-demo"
   ```

2. ✅ Monitor CloudWatch logs for any issues
   - Check for 500 errors
   - Verify auto-correlation completion messages

3. ✅ Test frontend integration
   - Login to the Alert Whisperer UI
   - Check if incidents are being created
   - Verify alerts are being correlated

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for:
  - HTTP 500 errors
  - Container health checks
  - ECS service status
- Monitor auto-correlation performance
- Track alert processing metrics
