## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **API Keys:** Store JWT tokens securely, never in code
2. **HTTPS Only:** All production traffic should use HTTPS
3. **Rate Limiting:** Webhooks are rate-limited to prevent abuse
4. **Audit Logs:** All operations are logged for compliance
5. **RBAC:** Use role-based access (admin vs technician)

---

## üì± Frontend Integration

The React frontend is available at:
```
https://alert-whisperer.preview.emergentagent.com
```

**Demo Credentials:**
- **Admin:** admin@alertwhisperer.com / admin123
- **Technician:** tech@acme.com / tech123

---

## üß™ Testing & Development

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Backend
cd /app/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# Frontend
cd /app/frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Seed Sample Data
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/seed
```

This creates:
- 3 demo companies
- 3 users (admin, 2 technicians)
- 5 runbooks
- 2 patch plans

---

## üé® Customization

### Custom Alert Signatures
Define custom alert signatures in your company policy:
```json
{
  "custom_signatures": [
    "database_replication_lag",
    "ssl_certificate_expiring",
    "backup_job_failed"
  ]
}
```

### Custom Decision Criteria
Modify decision engine priority scoring in `/app/backend/server.py`:
```python
severity_scores = {"low": 10, "medium": 30, "high": 60, "critical": 90}
duplicate_bonus = min(incident.alert_count * 2, 20)
priority_score = base_score + duplicate_bonus
```

---

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Webhook not receiving alerts:**
- Verify company_id and asset_name match exactly
- Check CORS settings if calling from browser
- Ensure Content-Type: application/json header

**Decision engine not generating:**
- Verify Gemini API key is set in backend/.env
- Check incident has matching runbook signature
- Review backend logs for errors

**Activity feed not updating:**
- Auto-refresh runs every 5 seconds
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify company_id is selected

### Logs
```bash
# Backend logs
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log

# Frontend logs (browser console)
```
