# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
#

##         All services restarted successfully. Everything now happens in real-time with full visibility!

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

          TESTED: HMAC webhook authentication working perfectly:
          ✅ HMAC signature verification logic confirmed in backend (compute_webhook_signature, verify_webhook_signature functions)
          ✅ Webhook accepts requests with API key only when HMAC is disabled
          ✅ Webhook correctly rejects requests without HMAC headers when enabled: "Missing required headers: X-Signature and X-Timestamp"
          ✅ Constant-time comparison implemented to prevent timing attacks
          ✅ 5-minute timestamp validation window for replay protection
          HMAC webhook security fully functional and production-ready

          ✅ COMPLETE SLA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED:
          
          Backend Services:
          1. SLA Service (sla_service.py):
             - Get/update SLA configuration per company
             - Calculate SLA deadlines (response + resolution times)
             - Support for business hours or 24/7 tracking
             - Default SLAs: critical (30min/4hrs), high (2hrs/8hrs), medium (8hrs/24hrs), low (24hrs/48hrs)
             - SLA status checking (on_track, warning, breached)
             - SLA compliance reporting (30-day lookback)
             - Automatic breach handling with escalation chain
          
          2. Escalation Service (escalation_service.py):
             - Background monitor checks for SLA breaches every 5 minutes
             - 3-level escalation chain: Technician → Company Admin → MSP Admin
             - Email notifications via AWS SES
             - In-app notifications for critical breaches
             - Audit logging for all escalations
          
          3. API Endpoints Added (server.py):
             - GET /api/companies/{company_id}/sla-config - Get SLA configuration
             - PUT /api/companies/{company_id}/sla-config - Update SLA settings
             - GET /api/incidents/{incident_id}/sla-status - Check current SLA status
             - POST /api/incidents/{incident_id}/sla-escalate - Manual escalation
             - GET /api/companies/{company_id}/sla-report?days=30 - Compliance report
             - PUT /api/incidents/{incident_id} - Update incident (tracks assigned_at, resolved_at)
          
          4. Enhanced Incident Model:
             - Added sla field with deadlines and tracking data
             - Added assigned_at field (for response SLA)
             - Added resolved_at, resolved_by, resolution_notes fields
             - Added escalated, escalated_at, escalation_reason, escalation_level fields
             - Added metadata field for AI analysis and other data
          
          5. Automatic SLA Tracking:
             - SLA deadlines calculated when incidents are created
             - Background task monitors SLA status every 5 minutes
             - Automatic escalation on response SLA breach (not assigned in time)
             - Automatic escalation on resolution SLA breach (not resolved in time)
             - WebSocket broadcasts for SLA breaches and escalations
          
          6. Integration Points:
             - Incident creation: Automatically calculates and stores SLA deadlines
             - Incident assignment: Tracks assigned_at for response SLA
             - Incident resolution: Tracks resolved_at for resolution SLA, calculates MTTR
             - Escalation: Email notifications + in-app notifications + audit logs
          
          7. Startup Services:
             - SLA service initialized on server startup
             - SLA monitor background task started
             - Escalation monitor already running (checks every 5 minutes)
          
          Testing Status:
          - Backend server restarted successfully
          - SLA service initialized: ✅
          - SLA monitor started: ✅
          - All endpoints compiled without errors

          **Test Improvements:**
          - Fixed test to reset SLA config to defaults before testing (eliminates inconsistent state)
          - Fixed test to create 2+ alerts for proper correlation (correlation requires multiple alerts)
          - All 9 tests now pass consistently with 100% success rate

          ✅ Noise reduction percentage correctly calculated: (alerts_correlated / active_before) * 100
          ✅ When no alerts to correlate: noise_reduction_pct = 0% (correct behavior)
          ✅ When alerts are correlated: noise_reduction_pct reflects actual noise reduction (100% when all alerts correlated)
          ✅ Incidents_created count is accurate and matches correlation results
          
          **Calculation Accuracy:**
          ✅ Noise calculation formula working correctly: noise_removed = alerts_correlated
          ✅ Percentage calculation handles edge cases (division by zero when no alerts)
          ✅ Non-zero noise reduction properly reflected when alerts are actually correlated

          ✅ Implemented intelligent auto-decide logic for incidents:
          
          Backend Changes (server.py):
          1. If runbook exists and is low-risk with auto-approve:
             - Auto-execute runbook immediately
             - Set status to "resolved"
             - Mark as auto_executed
          
          2. If no runbook or high-risk runbook:
             - Auto-assign to technician based on recommended category
             - Search for technicians in the incident's category
             - If no technicians in that category, assign to Custom/no-category technicians
             - Track assignment with assigned_to, assigned_at, assigned_technician_name
          
          3. WebSocket broadcast for real-time updates
          
          Frontend Changes (IncidentList.js):
          - Clicking "Decide" now auto-decides without opening dialog first
          - Shows immediate toast notification:
             * "Incident auto-resolved using runbook!" (if auto-executed)
             * "Incident assigned to [name]" (if auto-assigned)
             * "Decision generated successfully" (fallback)

          ✅ Auto-Decide Configuration and Execution System:
          
          Backend Implementation (server.py):
          1. AutoDecideConfig Model:
             - company_id: str
             - enabled: bool (default True)
             - interval_seconds: int (default 1)
             - last_run: Optional[str]
          
          2. Configuration Endpoints:
             - GET /api/auto-decide/config?company_id={id} - Get configuration
             - PUT /api/auto-decide/config - Update configuration
             - Returns default config if none exists (enabled=True, interval=1s)
          
          3. Execution Endpoint:
             - POST /api/auto-decide/run?company_id={id} - Run auto-decide for all NEW incidents
             - Processes incidents with status='new' without decisions
             - Calls decide_on_incident() for each incident
             - Returns statistics: incidents_processed, incidents_assigned, incidents_executed
             - Updates last_run timestamp
             - Broadcasts completion via WebSocket
          
          4. Integration with Incident Decision Logic:
             - Uses existing decide_on_incident() function
             - Tracks auto_executed and auto_assigned results
             - Provides comprehensive statistics for monitoring

          ✅ Simplified MSP-Like Onboarding:
          - Redesigned onboarding to 4-tab flow:
            1. Basic Info (company name, maintenance window)
            2. Security Settings (HMAC, rate limiting with sliders)
            3. Correlation Settings (time window, auto-correlate, AI explanation)
            4. Review & Create (comprehensive summary)
          
          - All settings configured in one place
          - No need to navigate to separate "Advanced Settings"
          - Interactive controls: Switches, sliders with real-time values
          - Visual badges showing enabled/disabled states
          - AI integration highlighted (Bedrock + Gemini)
          
          Auto-Configuration on Creation:
          - Calls webhook security enable API
          - Configures correlation settings API
          - Sets up rate limiting API
          - All happens automatically, user sees results immediately
