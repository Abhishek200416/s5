# 🔧 Login Fix - Deployment Summary

## Date: October 28, 2025 - 14:00 UTC

---

## ✅ Issue Resolution: **COMPLETE**

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Symptom
```
POST http://alertw-alb-1475356777.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/auth/login 
Status: 401 (Unauthorized)
```

### Root Cause
CloudWatch logs revealed a **bcrypt compatibility issue**:

```
AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'
```

**Cause**: The bcrypt library version 4.1.3 had breaking changes that were incompatible with passlib 1.7.4, preventing password verification during login.

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Changes Made
File: `/app/backend/requirements.txt`

```diff
- bcrypt==4.1.3
+ bcrypt==4.0.1

- passlib==1.7.4
+ passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4
```

### Why This Works
- **bcrypt 4.0.1**: Last stable version with `__about__` attribute that passlib expects
- **passlib[bcrypt]**: Explicitly includes bcrypt extras for proper integration
