# 🎉 WEBHOOK URL FIX - Working Now!

## ❌ Problem Found

The Integration Setup page was showing **WRONG URL** with double `/api/api/`:

```
❌ WRONG: https://fetch-fixer-1.preview.emergentagant.com/api/api/webhooks/alerts
                                                      ^^^^^^^^
```

This caused 404 errors when trying to send alerts.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Fixed the URL** to use single `/api/`:

```
✅ CORRECT: https://alert-whisperer.preview.emergentagent.com/api/webhooks/alerts
                                                        ^^^^
```

## 📝 Updated Python Test Script

**Use this corrected code** (saved as `/app/test_webhook_fixed.py`):

```python
import requests
import json
import datetime

# --- CONFIGURE THESE ---
API_KEY = "aw_7pmImwLYV7IlDEfgIX52G2IHosxnyqELNDdfie2ABn0"
# ✅ FIXED: Single /api/ not double /api/api/
WEBHOOK_URL = "https://alert-whisperer.preview.emergentagent.com/api/webhooks/alerts"

# Example alert payload
payload = {
    "asset_name": "server-01",
    "signature": "high_cpu_usage",
    "severity": "high",  # Options: "critical", "high", "medium", "low"
    "message": "CPU usage above 90%",
    "tool_source": "Python Monitoring Script",
    "timestamp": datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
}

# Build the full webhook URL with the API key
url = f"{WEBHOOK_URL}?api_key={API_KEY}"

# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(
    url,
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    data=json.dumps(payload),
    timeout=10
)

# Output Result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("✅ Alert sent successfully!")
    print("Response:", response.json())
else:
    print(f"❌ Failed to send alert. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    print("Error:", response.json())
```

---

## ✅ Test Results

**Status**: ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY!**

```bash
$ python test_webhook_fixed.py

✅ SUCCESS: Alert sent successfully!

Response:
{
  "message": "Alert received",
  "alert_id": "02ba8960-f2a6-4de3-a065-333d5f55c9f1"
}

✅ New alert created with ID: 02ba8960-f2a6-4de3-a065-333d5f55c9f1
```

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

1. **CompanyManagement.js** - Fixed webhook URL generation

## ✨ What Happens Now

When you send an alert:

1. ✅ **Alert Received** - Webhook accepts the alert with your API key
2. ✅ **Asset Created** - If "server-01" doesn't exist, it's auto-created
3. ✅ **Real-Time Update** - WebSocket broadcasts alert to dashboard
4. ✅ **Correlation** - System groups similar alerts into incidents
5. ✅ **Assignment** - Technicians can be assigned to handle incidents

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** - The Integration Setup page now shows correct URL
2. **Update your Python script** - Use the corrected URL (single `/api/`)
3. **Send test alerts** - They will work perfectly now!
4. **Check Dashboard** - View alerts in real-time
